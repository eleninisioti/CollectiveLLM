<human> You are a helpful assistant that plays a game called Little Alchemy 2.
I will give you instructions on how to play the game and examples of tasks.
Then, I will give you new tasks that you must play as best as you can.
The game is a textworld where you can combine items in pairs to create new items.
At the first round I will give you a set of items. For example: 'human', 'metal', 'fire', 'life', 'wall'.
You can combine two items to make a new one.
For example if you combine 'life' and 'metal' you get 'robot' because a piece of 'metal' that has 'life' is a robot.
You can also combine an item with itself.
For example you can combine 'wall' with 'wall' to make 'house'.
But not all combinations will give you a new item.
The game finds inspiration in the real world to determine which combinations are valid and which are not.
For example 'fire' and 'life' is an invalid combination, so it will not give you a new item.
The order of the two items does not matter: 'fire' and 'life' is the same combination with 'life' and 'fire'.
The goal of the game is to reach a target item.
In our example task the goal is 'cyborg'.
So you need to keep combining the items you have available to find the target item.
You should not attempt the same combination twice in a task.

At each round of a task I will give you the following information in the INPUT:

Inventory: this is a list of the available items that you can combine in pairs to make new items
Target: the item you need to create to successfully solve the task
Remaining rounds: the number of rounds remaining in the game. If it is one, this is your last chance to create the target item
Number of intermediate items: this is the number of intermediate items you need to craft before reaching the target item
Task valid combinations (do not repeat combinations here): a list of the combinations you tried in previous rounds of this task that gave you a new item. You should not repeat combinations in this list
Task invalid combinations (do not repeat combinations here): a list of the combinations you made in previous rounds of this task that did not give you a new item. You should not repeat combinations in this list

Your response should contain only the following information:

Combination: the two items you want to combine. Both items should be in your inventory
Reasoning: based on the information in the INPUT, do reasoning about why you made this Combination

Here is a simple example:

<human> INPUT:
Inventory: 'science', 'ocean', 'dinosaur'
Target: 'paleontologist'
Remaining rounds: 2
Number of intermediate items: 0
Task valid combinations (do not repeat combinations here):
Task invalid combinations (do not repeat combinations here):

<bot> RESPONSE:
Combination: 'science' and 'dinosaur'
Reasoning: In this task, I can craft the target item in a single round because 'number of intermediate items' is 0. A scientist that studies dinosaurs is a paleontologist, which is my target item, so I will combine 'scientist' and 'dinosaur'

Here is an example that shows you that you can combine an item with itself:

<human> INPUT:
Inventory: 'wall', 'dream', 'robot'
Target: 'house'
Remaining rounds: 2
Number of intermediate items: 0
Task valid combinations (do not repeat combinations here):
Task invalid combinations (do not repeat combinations here):


<bot> RESPONSE:
Combination: 'wall' and 'wall'
Reasoning: In this task, I can craft the target item in a single round because 'number of intermediate items' is 0. A house consists of multiple walls so I will combine 'wall' and 'wall'.

<human> Here is an example that shows how you can use the information provided in "Task valid combinations":

<human> INPUT:
Inventory: 'human', 'metal', 'fire', 'life', 'robot'
Target: 'cyborg'
Remaining rounds: 2
Number of intermediate items: 1
Task valid combinations (do not repeat combinations here): 'metal' and 'life -> 'robot'
Task invalid combinations (do not repeat combinations here):


<bot> RESPONSE:
Combination: 'robot' and 'human'
Reasoning: For this task, I need to create one intermediate item before reaching the target item. When I started this task 'robot' was not in my inventory. But I combined 'metal' and 'life' which gave the item 'robot'. This also means that I should not combine 'metal' and 'life' again, because I have already tried this combination. Now I can combine 'robot' and 'human' to make a 'cyborg' because a cyborg is a human with robotic parts.

<human> Here is an example that shows how you can use the information provided in "Task invalid combinations":

<human> INPUT:
Inventory: 'human', 'metal', 'fire', 'life'
Target: 'cyborg'
Remaining rounds: 2
Number of intermediate items: 1
Task valid combinations (do not repeat combinations here):
Task invalid combinations (do not repeat combinations here): 'fire' and 'life'


<bot> RESPONSE:
Combination: 'metal' and 'life'
Reasoning: In a previous round of this task I tried to combine 'fire' and 'life', so I should not try this combo again. My target item is 'cyborg' but I have to create an intermediate item before I can reach it. I can combine 'metal' and 'life'
to make a 'robot' because a robot is made of metal and behaves like a living organism and, in the next round, I will use 'robot' to create 'cyborg'.

<human> Here is an example that shows you how to use the information in the error message:

<human> INPUT:
Inventory: 'human', 'metal', 'fire', 'life', 'robot'
Target: 'cyborg'
Remaining rounds: 1
Number of intermediate items: 1
Task valid combinations (do not repeat combinations here): 'metal' and 'life -> 'robot'
Task invalid combinations (do not repeat combinations here):
You have already combined 'metal' and 'life', so you cannot repeat it. Try another one.


<bot> RESPONSE:
Combination: 'robot' and 'human'
Reasoning: I see in the Error message that I should not try combining 'metal' and 'life' because I have done it already. So I will make another combination.

<human> Here are some clarifications:
- To reason about which combinations to try, think about science! Combinations are inspired from the real world
- Your combination can only contain items that are in the inventory and cannot contain the target item
- The number of rounds a task starts with is independent of how many intermediate items you need to create before you reach the target item. For example, I may give you 3 remaining rounds but you can craft the target in a single round without creating an intermediate item. This is what happened in the first example with the 'paleontologist'.
- If you see a combination in 'Task valid combinations', you should not retry it as you already have the item.
- If you see a combination in 'Task invalid combinations', you should not retry it as you already have the item.
- Air, fire, earth and water will lead you to countless discoveries.
- Try mixing items with a copy of themselves â€” wall + wall will surely result in a house.
- Some items like human or plant will lead to more discoveries than others.
- The order of the two items you use in the combination does not matter. This means that if you have tried "water" and "earth", you should not try "earth" and "water".
