<human> You are a helpful assistant that plays a game called Little Alchemy 2.
I will give you instructions on how to play the game and examples of tasks.
Then, I will give you new tasks that you must play as best as you can.
The game is a textworld where you can combine items in pairs to create new items.
At the first round I will give you a set of items. For example: 'human', 'metal', 'fire', 'life', 'wall'.
You can combine two items to make new ones.
For example if you combine 'life' and 'metal' you get 'robot' because a piece of 'metal' that has 'life' is a robot.
You can also combine an item with   itself.
For example you can combine 'wall' with 'wall' to make 'house'.
But not all combinations will give you a new item.
The game finds inspiration in the real world to determine which combinations are valid and which are not.
For example 'fire' and 'life' is an invalid combination, so it will not give you a new item.
The order of the two items does not matter: 'fire' and 'life' is the same combination with 'life' and 'fire'.
The goal of the game is to discover all the possible items.
So you need to keep combining the items you have available to find new ones.
You should not attempt the same combination twice in a task.
The game contains hundreds of items so it is important to explore intelligently.
We know that when humans play this game, they explore using a method called empowerement.
Under the empowerement exploration method, you always choose to make the combinations that you think are more likely to lead to more discoveries.
For example, if you are thinking that combining 'philosophy' and 'house' will give you 'container' then you should attempt this combination, because containers are very useful to make other items.
But if you are thinking of making 'salt' by combing 'sea' and 'sun', then it is better to not try this combination because 'salt' can only be combined with one item!

For each task you will play multiple rounds and, at each round, I will give you the following information in the INPUT:

Inventory: this is a list of the available items that you can combine in pairs to make new items
Task valid combinations (do not repeat combinations here): a list of the combinations you tried in previous rounds of this task that gave you a new item. ou should not repeat combinations in this list
Task invalid combinations (do not repeat combinations here): a list of the combinations you made in previous rounds of this task that did not give you a new item. ou should not repeat combinations in this list

Your response should contain only the following information:

Combination: the two items you want to combine. Both items should be in your inventory
Reasoning: based on the information in the INPUT, do reasoning about why you chose this combination. Within your reasoning you should state what item you think this combination will produce and how empowering it is (little, medium, very)

Here is a simple example:

<human> INPUT:
Inventory: 'philosophy', 'house', 'sea'
Task valid combinations (do not repeat combinations here):
Task invalid combinations (do not repeat combinations here):

<bot> RESPONSE:
Combination: 'philosophy' and 'house'
Reasoning: I expect to get 'container' because the purpose of a box is to serve as a container for humans. This is a very empowering item

<human> Here is an example that shows how that you can sometimes combine an element with itself:

Inventory: 'wall', 'earth', 'mud', 'angel'
Task valid combinations (do not repeat combinations here):
Task invalid combinations (do not repeat combinations here):

<bot> RESPONSE:
Combination: 'wall' and 'wall'
Reasoning: I expect to get 'house' because it contains multiple walls. This is a medium empowering item


<human> Here is an example that shows how you can use the information provided in "Task valid combinations":

Inventory: 'wall', 'earth', 'mud', 'angel', 'philosophy', 'house'
Task valid combinations (do not repeat combinations here): 'wall' + 'wall' -> 'house'
Task invalid combinations (do not repeat combinations here):

<bot> RESPONSE:
Combination: 'house and 'philosophy'
Reasoning: I see that I have already combined 'wall' and 'wall' to create a 'house' so I should not try this combination again. I expect to get 'container' from combining 'philosophy' and 'house'. This is a very empowering item.

<human> Here are some clarifications:
- To reason about which combinations to try, think about science! Combinations are inspired from the real world
- If you see a combination in 'Task valid combinations', you should not retry it as you already have the item.
- If you see a combination in 'Task invalid combinations', you should not retry it as you already have the item.
- Air, fire, earth and water will lead you to countless discoveries.
- Try mixing items with a copy of themselves â€” wall + wall will surely result in a house.
- Some items like human or plant will lead to more discoveries than others.
- The order of the two items you use in the combination does not matter. This means that if you have tried "water" and "earth", you should not try "earth" and "water".
- If you can think of multiple items to make then you should always pick the most empowering one
- But if you have already tried a combination you should not retry it even if it is empowering.
