<human> You are a helpful assistant that plays a game called Little Alchemy 2.
I will give you instructions on how to play the game and examples of tasks.
Then, I will give you new tasks that you must play as best as you can.
The game is a textworld where you can combine items in pairs to create new items.
At the first round I will give you a set of items. For example: 'human', 'metal', 'fire', 'life', 'wall'.
You can combine two items to make new ones.
For example if you combine 'life' and 'metal' you get 'robot' because a piece of 'metal' that has 'life' is a robot.
You can also combine an item with   itself.
For example you can combine 'wall' with 'wall' to make 'house'.
But not all combinations will give you a new item.
The game finds inspiration in the real world to determine which combinations are valid and which are not.
For example 'fire' and 'life' is an invalid combination, so it will not give you a new item.
The order of the two items does not matter: 'fire' and 'life' is the same combination with 'life' and 'fire'.
The goal of the game is to discover all the possible items.
So you need to keep combining the items you have available to find new ones.
You should not attempt the same combination twice in a task.

For each task you will play multiple rounds and, at each round, I will give you the following information in the INPUT:

Inventory: this is a list of the available items that you can combine in pairs to make new items

Your response should contain only the following information:

Combination: the two items you want to combine. Both items should be in your inventory
Reasoning: based on the information in the INPUT, do reasoning about why you chose this combination

Here is a simple example:

<human> INPUT:
Inventory: 'science', 'ocean', 'dinosaur'


<bot> RESPONSE:
Combination: 'science' and 'dinosaur'
Reasoning: a scientist that studies dinosaurs is a paleontologist, which is a new item

<human> Here is an example that shows how that you can sometimes combine an element with itself:

Inventory: 'wall', 'earth', 'mud', 'angel'


<bot> RESPONSE:
Combination: 'wall' and 'wall'
Reasoning: I can combine an element with itself so I will create a house by combining two walls

<human> Here is an example that shows how you can use the information provided in "Task valid combinations":

<human> INPUT:
Inventory: 'human', 'metal', 'fire', 'life', 'robot'

<bot> RESPONSE:
Combination: 'robot' and 'human'
Reasoning: When I started this task 'robot' was not in my inventory. But I combined 'metal' and 'life' which gave the item 'robot'. This means that I cannot combine "metal" and "life" again. Now I can combine 'robot' and 'human' to make a 'cyborg' because a cyborg is a human with robotic parts.

<human> Here is an example that shows how you can use the information provided in "Task invalid combinations":

<human> INPUT:
Inventory: 'human', 'metal', 'fire', 'life'

<bot> RESPONSE:
Combination: 'metal' and 'life'
Reasoning: In a previous round of this task I tried to combine 'fire' and 'life' and didn't get a new item. So I should not try this combo again.  I can combine 'metal' and 'life' to make a 'robot' because a robot is made of metal and behaves like a living organism.


<human> Here are some clarifications:
- To reason about which combinations to try, think about science! Combinations are inspired from the real world
- Your combination can only contain items that are in the inventory
- If an item is in your inventory, you should not try to create it again
- Air, fire, earth and water will lead you to countless discoveries.
- Try mixing items with a copy of themselves â€” wall + wall will surely result in a house.
- Some items like human or plant will lead to more discoveries than others.
- The order of the two items you use in the combination does not matter. This means that if you have tried "water" and "earth", you should not try "earth" and "water".
